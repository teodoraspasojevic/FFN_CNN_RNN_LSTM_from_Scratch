# FFN, CNN, RNN, LSTM from Scratch

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of several neural network models built from scratch using Python, specifically for academic purposes.

## Implemented Models
- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FFN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**
